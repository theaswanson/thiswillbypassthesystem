I would like to thank Everyone for telling me how to do the bypass. I wondered where everybody had been!

This is good to know: It's ridiculous to have over 540 friends and only 25 are allowed to see my post.

It WORKS!! I have a whole new news feed. I'm seeing posts from people I haven't seen in years.

Here's how to bypass the system FB now has in place that limits posts on your news feed.

Their new algorithm chooses the same few people - about 25 - who will read your posts.

Therefore,

Hold your finger down anywhere in this post and "copy" will pop up. Click "copy". Then go your page, start a new post and put your finger anywhere in the blank field. "Paste" will pop up and click paste.

This will bypass the system.

If you are reading this message, do me a favor and leave me a quick comment...a "hello," a sticker, whatever you want, so you will appear in my newsfeed!
