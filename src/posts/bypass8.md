I think itâ€™s time to go back to school. Ummm. Recently a family member and a friend asked me why I blocked them. I was confused. I checked just in case and there were no blocked people on my list. Then I see this. Hmmm, I am not the only one. So now I am fixing my blocked posts. I wondered where everybody had been! This is good to know. It's ridiculous to have 450 friends and only 25 are allowed to see posts. I ignored this post earlier because I didnâ€™t think it worked. It WORKS!! I have a whole new news feed. Iâ€™m seeing posts from people I havenâ€™t seen in years.

Hereâ€™s how to bypass the system FB now has in place that limits posts on your news feed. Their new algorithm chooses the same few people - about 25 - who will read your posts...okay here goes....

HELLO. To regain friends in your news feed and get rid of ads - Hold your finger anywhere in this post and click â€²copyâ€™. Go to your page where it says â€˜What's on your mind?â€™ Tap your finger anywhere in the blank field. Click paste.

This upgrades the system.

Hello new and old friends!ðŸ¥°
It's sad we have to keep doing this to kill the Ads and see our friends helloðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤¦
