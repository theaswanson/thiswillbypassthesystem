Don't forget that tomorrow starts the new Facebook rule where Mark Zuckerberg can sneak into your kitchen at night and eat whatever he wants from your refrigerator.

To stop him from doing that, copy and paste this message on your Facebook feed:

"I do not authorize Mark Zuckerberg to sneak into my house and eat anything in my refrigerator. With this statement, I notify Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg to leave my milk, eggs, butter, cheese, veggies, sandwich meats, pickles, and leftover pizza alone."

After you copy and paste this message, the light in your refrigerator will blink three times, and then turn blue ðŸ”µ. Youâ€™re good to go.  Mark won't be able to eat your food.
